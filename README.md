# mod_articles_popdate
This Module shows a list of the currently published Articles which have the highest number of page views. Date range is optional, turn it off or filter by Relative Date or Date Range and you are able to exclude articles by their ID from the generated list. Many thanks go to the request from Toowoomba Regional Council that made this extension possible through their request, now shared with the community.
